            <p>The demand for online learning has increased dramatically over the past decade through the advancements in Learning Management Systems (LMS) and web technologies. This has enabled students to learn in a virtually paperless environment. As online course developers and system administrators are becoming experts in the LMS technology, development of online courses have also matured. The leadership at the Learning and Teaching Centre formed a Course Production team to focus on the standardizing visual communication, code, and production workflow.
                <blockquote>We adopted a design system and course content guidelines with the goal of improveing the student online learning experience</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>Having introduced and supported our LMS since it's inception, it was clear the need for standardization of our visual communication and code was pertinent to creating a sustainable and student-friendly learning experience.</p>
            <h2>The Challenges</h2>
            <h3>Technical debt and bottlenecks</h3>
            <p>Technical and design debt accrued without throughout the years prior to the creation of a design system to ensure our courses adhered to specific guidelines. 
                <p>
                    Bottlenecks appeared as demands for online project grew. This often led to project delays and unaccounted risks that effected the output and quality of the courses produced in an adverse manner.  
                </p>

                <h3>Buy-in</h3>
                <p>For the majority of stakeholders, a design system seemed beneficial. By being inclusive in our decision making by continually gathering feedback, we won over many of stakeholders who were originally against the idea by showing them the improved quality and efficencies gained from the use of a design system.</p>
                <h2>The Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    Through a lean assessment, the team was able to identify bottlenecks and adopt recommendations. Standardization was emphasized in our findings and part of the course production team we knew this was the best way forward.</p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Style Guide</h3>
                    <p>Standardizing our visual elements was one of the first things we addressed. Design foundations such as typography, colours, layouts, iconography helped lay the foundation for effective design. We also solicited advice from our Marketing and Web Services teams at BCIT to ensure we were aligning with the institutes brand guidelines.</p>

                    <h3>Agile Development</h3>
                    <p>A Kanban board informed stakeholders on the status of their project. The transparency of project progress allowed for open conversations about timelines and expected deliverables while addressing delays and challenges of projects.</p>

                    <h3>Project Management</h3>
                    <p>We have adopted <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/">Teamwork</a> as project management software as it has been a very intuitive project management tool that allows teams to seamlessly communicate, share files, plan projects, manage timelines, track progress.</p>

                    <h3>Automation</h3>
                    <p>Automating production by using an app we developed in-house called <a href="https://github.com/BCIT-LTC/dewordify">Dewordify</a> was a major game changer for how we do produce online courses. Read more about it <a href="https://edtechfactotum.com/clean-up-word-to-html-with-dewordify/">here</a>.
                        <blockquote>Hello Command Line, Goodbye ctrl C &amp; V! </blockquote>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Version Control</h3>
                    <p>We found <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> to be an indespensible application for collaborating on projects, development of our code framework, tracking issues and feature requests.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Results</h2>
                    <p>The creation of a design system and following Lean assessment recommendations of standardizing operations provided numerous benefits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Doubled course production year over year.</li>
                            <li>Production workflow has been streamlined with clear documentation for reference and training purposes.</li>
                            <li>Continual maintenance and updates are easy with standardized visual elements and a code base stored on Github.</li>
                            <li>Addressed bottlenecks within the production process by focussing on Agile methodoligies.</li>
                            <li>Increased transparency of production timelines.</li>
                            <li>Build trust and accountability amongst project team members.</li>
                        </ul>
